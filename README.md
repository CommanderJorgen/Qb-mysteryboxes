# What is this

This is a simple configurable mystery boxes script for QB-Core. 

There are 4 mystery boxes that contain different types of items all of which are changeable in the shared folder in the config.lua. 

The CyberBar Mystery Box is the Funko Pop Mystery Box. (They have Game of Thrones and Harry Potter Funko Pops inside.)

The Regular box contains food and other store-bought items, the Funko Pop box contains the Funko Pops included in the README and Images folder (GoT and Harry Potter), the rare box contains special limited-edition action figures, and the Illegal box has several guns within. All of these can be changes in the config.lua as well as more items can be added to it so that more items are given from each box.
